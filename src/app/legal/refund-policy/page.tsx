                    <p>
                        Due to the digital nature of our course content, we generally do not offer refunds once the course has been accessed or the package has been purchased. Please read the details of the package carefully before making a purchase.

                    <p>
                        In exceptional cases, such as accidental double payment or technical errors preventing access to the course content that we are unable to resolve, we may consider a refund request at our sole discretion.
                    </p>
